# snake-game-tutorial
used a youtube tutorial to learn more about pygame and python in general

I followed a tutorial from youtube that walked me through creating a snake game using pygame. Felt like it was something interesting to so while also learning more about using python.
I changed a few things but they were simple color changes or swapping out a png so far. I'm going to try to add more functionality to it over time (like a fruit that gives double points or difficulty settings that speeds up the snake I don't know yet) and see if they work.

just to make sure : THIS IS NOT MINE AND WAS USED TO LEARN

The actual code is from Clear Code. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFvqStqPCRU&t
